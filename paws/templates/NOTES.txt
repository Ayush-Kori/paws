Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}!

An essential part of setting up your dev environment is adding a hosts file entry.
Get the IP of minikube with:
minikube ip
Add these lines to your hosts file:
<ip address> {{ index .Values.jupyterhub.ingress.hosts 0 }}
<ip address> {{ .Values.pawspublic.ingress.host }}

You can override any values you need in a file called dev-values.yaml.

If you create one, run:
helm -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} upgrade {{ .Release.Name }} paws/ -f dev-values.yaml
Happy hacking.
